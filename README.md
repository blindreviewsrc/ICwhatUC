# Abstract

The global COVID-19 pandemic brings new challenges. Python-based domain-specific languages, Jupyter notebooks, and Google Colab notebooks can help generate creative solutions to computer resources and software problems that educators and students face with remote teaching. However, we believe that less is more for first-year students. Therefore, we provide a minimalist and portable interface suitable for notebooks and smartphones to introduce digital logic design and Verilog language. Our approach uses a new client-server model. The instructor manages Colab notebooks to create and reuse simple assignments and exam questions, generating a linked server using Gradio. Students connect as clients to solve Verilog assignments by using a simple interface. The Colab notebook instructor server compiles, simulates, verifies, and grades the student submissions. All examples are open-source for collaborative development. Furthermore, we show how intermediate, advanced, and graduate students can create an interactive interface to verify RISC-V processors and cache designs using the proposed approach.
